        <b>Here is the list of the following cities where I lived</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>Vijaywada</i></b>
                <br>
                <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.98f8fc9192f162fa5cd60aff426d793d?rik=NyI5LU39p30bbg&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tajhotels.com%2fcontent%2fdam%2fthrp%2fdestinations%2fVijaywada%2f16x7intro%2fVijayawada-Intro-4X3_Ankush.jpg&ehk=XL4XhmXTTykku8ZO7u0pQ4R9Q1fFDZ3GISU09zQXJro%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
                <br>
            <p>
                I was born in this city and due to this city only my tastebuds has a special place for South Indian Delicacies
            </p>
            
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Merrut</i></b>
                <br>
                <img src="https://meerutbn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hastinapur-1024x760.jpg">
                <br>

            <p>
                Due to my Father's transferable job after Vijaywada I shifted to this city where initially I faced a lot of language barriers due to my first language being Telgu </p>
                <br>
                But this barrier didn't lasted for long and due to this city my tastebuds became "Chatori" as it started to love the flavor burst of golgappe, bhelpuri, papdi chaat and so on.
            
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Indore</i></b>
                <br>
                <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/compressed/3551.jpg?v=1.1">
                <br>
            <p>
                Now comes the city which completely transformed me into a FOOD LOVER 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The food of this city is just so amazing that I am getting water in my mouth while writing this website
                The aroma the taste...the love with which it is made is enough for a person to get a "FOODGASM"
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The famous KHAU GAALI street foods, SARAFAA BAZAAR and so much uncountable places will drive a food lover crazy enough such that he/she will want to stay rest of their lives in this city only
            </p>

            </li>
            <li><b><i>Varanasi</i></b>
                <br>
                <img src="https://www.harivara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kashi-Vishwanath-Temple-in-Varanasi.jpg">
                <br>
            <p>The HOLY city and one of the oldest cities of the world gave spiritual vibes as soon as you enter the city</p>
            <p>The small lanes, the ghats, the Holy River Ganges  completely bought out the spiritual person inside me and is the major reason for my belief in the Holy Divine</p>
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Jaipur</i></b>
                <br>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4c/be/ab/4cbeab9d89ea2a98d69c1ce6ee393b13.jpg"width="500" height="500">
                <br>
            <p>The capital of Rajasthan, the city with the royal aura gave me one of the best experiences of life</p>
            <p>This city gave me so much experiences that was missing till now, an amazing school life, awesome friends, marvellous night life and many more</p>
